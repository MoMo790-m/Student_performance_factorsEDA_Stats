# Student Performance Factors â€“ EDA & Statistical Analysis

This project explores the factors that influence students' academic performance, focusing on variables like gender, parental education, and study time. The goal was to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and perform hypothesis testing to understand how these factors contribute to students' academic outcomes.

## What Did I Do?

### Data Cleaning & Preparation:
- Loaded the dataset and inspected the structure.
- Renamed columns for easier handling.
- Checked for missing values (there were no missing values in the dataset).
- Examined basic information like data types and summary statistics.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Analyzed the distribution of students' scores in math, reading, and writing.
- Investigated the relationship between students' gender and performance in each subject.
- Analyzed the impact of study time on performance.
- Investigated how different parental education levels affect student scores.
- Grouped data by categorical features such as gender, parental level of education, and study time.
- Visualized the score distributions and relationships using histograms, box plots, and density plots.

### Hypothesis Testing:
- Performed statistical tests to compare means of groups:
  - Tested whether there's a significant difference in performance between male and female students.
  - Analyzed the impact of parental education level on student performance.
  - Analyzed the effect of study time on performance.

### Key Findings:
- Female students scored higher in reading and writing, while male students slightly outperformed females in math.
- Parental education had a noticeable positive impact on student scores, with students of highly educated parents performing better.
- Students who studied more hours scored higher across all subjects.

## Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates how exploratory data analysis and statistical testing can reveal important patterns in educational data. Understanding how factors like parental education, study time, and gender influence performance can help educators, policymakers, and students themselves make better-informed decisions for improving academic outcomes.
